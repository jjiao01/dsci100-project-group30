    "In the gaming industry, it is crucial to understand player behaviour in order to enhance user experience. In particular, a research group in Computer Science at UBC is collecting data about video game playing. To do so, they are using a Minecraft server - a popular open-world sandbox game that allows players to build, explore, and survive in a block-based virtual world. The broad question of interest is which \"kinds\" of players, measured by their experience level, are most likely to contribute to a large amount of data, measured by their session duration. This is to ensure that the number of licenses on hand is sufficiently large enough to accommodate all players at the same time with a high probability. \n",

Moreover, linear regression assumes that there is a linear relationship between the predictors and the dependent variable, which makes it useful for quantifying how each player characteristic contributes to the total data contribution. Furthermore, linear regression works well on small datasets whereas k-nn regression can be more sensitive to small sample sizes and noise (especially when the predictor is not numeric)."

    "**Interpretation**: Points are widely scattered around the diagonal reference line, with no clear clustering or trend. This confirms that the linear model fails to accurately predict session duration from experience level. Many points deviate significantly from the red line, especially at higher durations, which shows that the model underestimates variability in the outcome. These results are consistent with the regression output, where R² was extremely low and all predictors were non-significant. Overall, this visualization reinforces the conclusion that experience level alone does not explain session behavior."

    "The key finding — that player experience level does not significantly predict session duration — has several important implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Server infrastructure planning: Game developers cannot rely solely on experience level to estimate playtime. To avoid server overloads, they may need to plan based on peak usage scenarios rather than user categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Rethinking player segmentation: This challenges the assumption that more experienced players are always more engaged. Companies may need to refine their user segmentation models using additional variables such as age, time of day, or player activity patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Improving marketing and retention strategies: Since experience level alone isn’t a strong indicator of engagement, personalized offers or in-game content should be targeted based on a more nuanced understanding of player behavior."

    "1. Are there other variables that better predict session duration? For example, does age, gender, or in-game behavior offer better predictive power?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Are there interactions between variables? Perhaps experience level only matters when combined with other factors, like time of day or subscription status.\n",
